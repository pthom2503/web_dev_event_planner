# Design decisions
### There are no speficiations for restraint on who can edit users, so anyone can edit and delete any users
### When someone is invited to an event who is not in the system, the system makes a default user for that email address. Registering with that email address will overwrite the default name and profile picture
### Must comment something in order to respond about attendance
### Profile pictures have no aspect ratio requirement but may not fill the square allotted space if they are rectangular
### When a user goes to the invite link, they will have to sign in or register. This will take them to a workflow where they can see all their invited events, which provides a clear path for the user to follow
